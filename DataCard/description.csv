eeg,"Electroencephalography, accelerometer, gyroscope, and other data from the device are structured in the .csv file as follow:  1. column: the timestamp in Unix time of sample collection. 2. – 21. columns: the processed EEG data for each channel in the 5 frequency bands (respectively: Delta-TP9, Delta-AF7, Delta-AF8, Delta-TP10; Theta-TP9, Theta-AF7, Theta-AF8, Theta-TP10, Alpha-TP9, Alpha-AF7, Alpha-AF8, Alpha-TP10, Beta-TP9, Beta-AF7, Beta-AF8, Beta-TP10, Gamma-TP9, Gamma-AF7, Gamma-AF8, Gamma-TP10). The decomposition algorithm used is Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with a Hamming window. 22. – 25. columns: the raw EEG data for respectively TP9, AF7, AF8, TP10 channels in microvolt (uV). 26. – 27. columns: are two extra channels (AUX_RIGHT and AUX_LEFT respectively) that were not used for our purpose. The values that they contain show the open channels noise. 28. – 30. columns: are the accelerometer data for respectively x, y, z axis measured in g (m/s2), where the x-axis represents the tilt up/down, the y-axis the tilt left/right, and the z-axis the vertical motion up/down (e.g. jumping). 31. – 33. columns: are the gyroscope data for respectively x, y, z axis measured in (degree/s), where the x-axis represents the tilt left/right (Roll), y the tilt up/down (Pitch) and z the rotation left/right (Yaw). 34. column: is the value showing the switched-on device (Headband On). 35. – 38. columns: are HIS channels (Horse Shoe Indicator) showing the sensor connectivity status. 39. column: is the battery status of the device. 40. column: “Elements” shows events occurred during the recording and automatically stored such as the connection of the device, blink, jaw_clench.
